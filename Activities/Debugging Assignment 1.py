Hello!

I am trying to write a program that will ask the user for their name. After I ask the user for
their name, I want to ask what their favorite color is. I want to make sure the user's color
is read in lower case, that way the program won't have any issues reading it. However, my code
won't run! Can you help me fix it?

def main():
    print("Hi there!)
    username = input("Please input your name: ")
    fav_color = input("Hi " , username , ", what is your favorite color: ")

    if Fav_color = "red":
        print("Hey, that's my favorite color too!")
    elif Fav_color = "gray":
        print("Ugh, that's my least favorite color!")
    else:
        print("Nice color!")
